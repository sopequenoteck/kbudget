# Specification Quality Checklist: Flutter Setup & Architecture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec references "Spring Boot" and "JWT" in the server mode context — these are references to the *existing* system the app connects to, not implementation prescriptions for the Flutter app itself. Acceptable.
- "DataRepository" is described as a concept (abstraction layer), not an implementation pattern. Acceptable.
- All 14 functional requirements map to at least one acceptance scenario.
- All 7 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics.
